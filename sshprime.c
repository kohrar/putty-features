/*
 * This prime generation algorithm is pretty much cribbed from
 * OpenSSL. The algorithm is:
 *
 *  - invent a B-bit random number and ensure the top and bottom
 *    bits are set (so it's definitely B-bit, and it's definitely
 *    odd)
 *
 *  - see if it's coprime to all primes below 2^16; increment it by
 *    two until it is (this shouldn't take long in general)
 *
 *  - perform the Miller-Rabin primality test enough times to
 *    ensure the probability of it being composite is 2^-80 or
 *    less
 *
 *  - go back to square one if any M-R test fails.

/*
 * The Miller-Rabin primality test is an extension to the Fermat
 * test. The Fermat test just checks that a^(p-1) == 1 mod p; this
 * is vulnerable to Carmichael numbers. Miller-Rabin considers how
 * that 1 is derived as well.
 *
 * Lemma: if a^2 == 1 (mod p), and p is prime, then either a == 1
 * or a == -1 (mod p).
 *
 *   Proof: p divides a^2-1, i.e. p divides (a+1)(a-1). Hence,
 *   since p is prime, either p divides (a+1) or p divides (a-1).
 *   But this is the same as saying that either a is congruent to
 *   -1 mod p or a is congruent to +1 mod p. []
 *
 *   Comment: This fails when p is not prime. Consider p=mn, so
 *   that mn divides (a+1)(a-1). Now we could have m dividing (a+1)
 *   and n dividing (a-1), without the whole of mn dividing either.
 *   For example, consider a=10 and p=99. 99 = 9 * 11; 9 divides
 *   10-1 and 11 divides 10+1, so a^2 is congruent to 1 mod p
 *   without a having to be congruent to either 1 or -1.
 *
 * So the Miller-Rabin test, as well as considering a^(p-1),
 * considers a^((p-1)/2), a^((p-1)/4), and so on as far as it can
 * go. In other words. we write p-1 as q * 2^k, with k as large as
 * possible (i.e. q must be odd), and we consider the powers
 *
 *       a^(q*2^0)      a^(q*2^1)          ...  a^(q*2^(k-1))  a^(q*2^k)
 * i.e.  a^((n-1)/2^k)  a^((n-1)/2^(k-1))  ...  a^((n-1)/2)    a^(n-1)
 *
 * If p is to be prime, the last of these must be 1. Therefore, by
 * the above lemma, the one before it must be either 1 or -1. And
 * _if_ it's 1, then the one before that must be either 1 or -1,
 * and so on ... In other words, we expect to see a trailing chain
 * of 1s preceded by a -1. (If we're unlucky, our trailing chain of
 * 1s will be as long as the list so we'll never get to see what
 * lies before it. This doesn't count as a test failure because it
 * hasn't _proved_ that p is not prime.)
 *
 * For example, consider a=2 and p=1729. 1729 is a Carmichael
 * number: although it's not prime, it satisfies a^(p-1) == 1 mod p
 * for any a coprime to it. So the Fermat test wouldn't have a
 * problem with it at all, unless we happened to stumble on an a
 * which had a common factor.
 *
 * So. 1729 - 1 equals 27 * 2^6. So we look at
 *
 *     2^27 mod 1729 == 645
 *    2^108 mod 1729 == 1065
 *    2^216 mod 1729 == 1
 *    2^432 mod 1729 == 1
 *    2^864 mod 1729 == 1
 *   2^1728 mod 1729 == 1
 *
 * We do have a trailing string of 1s, so the Fermat test would
 * have been happy. But this trailing string of 1s is preceded by
 * 1065; whereas if 1729 were prime, we'd expect to see it preceded
 * by -1 (i.e. 1728.). Guards! Seize this impostor.
 *
 * (If we were unlucky, we might have tried a=16 instead of a=2;
 * now 16^27 mod 1729 == 1, so we would have seen a long string of
 * 1s and wouldn't have seen the thing _before_ the 1s. So, just
 * like the Fermat test, for a given p there may well exist values
 * of a which fail to show up its compositeness. So we try several,
 * just like the Fermat test. The difference is that Miller-Rabin
 * is not _in general_ fooled by Carmichael numbers.)
 *
 * Put simply, then, the Miller-Rabin test requires us to:
 *
 *  1. write p-1 as q * 2^k, with q odd
 *  2. compute z = (a^q) mod p.
 *  3. report success if z == 1 or z == -1.
 *  4. square z at most k-1 times, and report success if it becomes
 *     -1 at any point.
 *  5. report failure otherwise.
 *
 * (We expect z to become -1 after at most k-1 squarings, because
 * if it became -1 after k squarings then a^(p-1) would fail to be
 * 1. And we don't need to investigate what happens after we see a
 * -1, because we _know_ that -1 squared is 1 modulo anything at
 * all, so after we've seen a -1 we can be sure of seeing nothing
 * but 1s.)

/*
 * Generate a prime. We can deal with various extra properties of
 * the prime:
 *
 *  - to speed up use in RSA, we can arrange to select a prime with
 *    the property (prime % modulus) != residue.
 *
 *  - for use in DSA, we can arrange to select a prime which is one
 *    more than a multiple of a dirty great bignum. In this case
 *    `bits' gives the size of the factor by which we _multiply_
 *    that bignum, rather than the size of the whole number.
 *
 *  - for the basically cosmetic purposes of generating keys of the
 *    length actually specified rather than off by one bit, we permit
 *    the caller to provide an unsigned integer 'firstbits' which will
 *    match the top few bits of the returned prime. (That is, there
 *    will exist some n such that (returnvalue >> n) == firstbits.) If
 *    'firstbits' is not needed, specifying it to either 0 or 1 is
 *    an adequate no-op.
